# Dashboard

This application presents the Finance dashboard for my startup company. 

It performs the following major functions:
    - ingest a csv file export (from our bank account)
    - parse the input file and extract information
    - store gathered data in new output file
    - add category to each line (payment)
    - create a simple visualization for categories
